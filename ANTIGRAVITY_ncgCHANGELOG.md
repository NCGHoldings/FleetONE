### ✅ Yutong Finance Sync UX & AR Auto-Creation Fix

**Problem:** Users were confused when creating Tax Invoices because the "Sync" button was missing and Master AR was not automatically created. The Master AR creation failed silently because the `finance_customer_id` had not been established yet. The Sync button was missing because the invoice remained in `draft` status instead of `approved`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useYutongOrderInvoiceManagement.ts` — Added `createVehicleCustomer` logic inside `generateAndStoreDraftInvoice` so that a `finance_customer_id` is guaranteed to exist. This allows the system to successfully auto-create the draft Master AR invoice immediately at generation time, instead of failing silently.
- `src/components/yutong/YutongOrderInvoiceGenerator.tsx` — Added an inline `Approve` button (with a green styling) directly on the main invoice row for any invoice in `draft` status. This fixes the UX gap where the Approve button was previously hidden inside the "View" modal, causing users to mistakenly believe the invoice generation had failed or skipped finance integration.

### ✅ School Bus Master Expenses Pipeline

**Problem:** The School Bus operations needed to be brought into the Master Data Pipeline for bulk uploading financial data, but required "full flexibility" (i.e. hybrid mapping to both Vehicles and GL Accounts simultaneously).

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/accounting/expenses/MasterExpenseUploader.tsx` — Added "School Bus" to the supported sectors list for smart data mapping.
- `src/components/accounting/expenses/ExpenseMappingGrid.tsx` — Enabled a hybrid mapping grid for the School Bus sector. It now displays both the `Vehicle Mapping` column (for operational analytics tracking) and the `Expense Account / Payment Mode` columns (for direct GL posting). Modified `postSingleToGL` to include `cost_center_id: mapped_vehicle_id` in the generated journal entry lines, ensuring vehicle data propagates to the ledger.

**Architecture Notes:**
- "School Bus" expenses are now fully integrated into the Master Data Pipeline and post directly to the GL while retaining analytical linkages to specific vehicles via the `cost_center_id` on the journal entry lines.

### ✅ Team Leader Operational Matrix & Submission Dashboard Overhaul

**Problem:** Operational oversight was grouped strictly by route, making it difficult to track daily fleet assignments, coverage, and conductor submissions by Team Leader. "Unassigned" buses were not surfaced effectively.
 
**Root Cause:** The grouping logic in both the Fleet Master Spreadsheet and the Conductor Submission Matrix only aggregated buses based on their route labels.
 
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/fleet/FleetMasterSpreadsheetCore.tsx` — Restructured the Fleet Sheet table sections to group rows by Team Leader. Added a blue section header displaying `[Team Leader: Name]` prepended to the route name to provide immediate visual identification for the supervisor.
- `src/components/trips/SubmissionMatrixDashboard.tsx` — Refactored the `Daily Detail View` to utilize a `Map`-based clustering strategy. Buses are now first grouped by `Team Leader`, then by Route. Added color-coded Team Leader header banners (incorporating `getLeaderColor` tokens) to cleanly separate daily operations accountability.
 
**Architecture Notes:**
- "Unassigned" buses are intentionally clustered at the end of the detail matrix with a dedicated visual header to enforce operational oversight and 100% assignment compliance.
- The `fleetMatrix` logic now correctly reflects real-time leader changes from `useFleetMasterSpreadsheet.ts` without requiring a hard refresh.

### ✅ Master Expenses — Quotation Mapping Visibility Fix

**Problem:** Quotation numbers (e.g., QUO-2026-1842) were not appearing in the "Quotation Mapping" dropdown on the Master Data Pipeline page. The system had 3035+ quotations but the fetch was limited to the 500 most recent, causing older quotations to be invisible and unmappable.

**Root Cause:** `fetchMappingDictionaries()` in `ExpenseMappingGrid.tsx` used `.limit(500)` which excluded quotations beyond the newest 500 records.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/accounting/expenses/ExpenseMappingGrid.tsx` — Replaced `.limit(500)` with paginated fetch loop (1000 records per page) that loads ALL quotations. Each record is ~200 bytes, so even 5000 records = ~1MB — well within browser limits.
- `src/components/accounting/expenses/SearchableSelect.tsx` — **Rewritten** to handle large datasets efficiently. Added `maxDisplayed` prop (default: 100) that limits initial DOM rendering, with client-side pre-filtering via `shouldFilter={false}` + manual search. When user types a search query, it filters the full options array. Shows "Showing X of Y — type to search all" note when truncated.

**Architecture Notes:**
- The `SearchableSelect` now uses `shouldFilter={false}` on the `Command` component and implements its own pre-filtering logic, avoiding cmdk's default behavior of rendering all items in the DOM
- Quotation search is now instant and covers the entire dataset regardless of size
- The `PopoverContent` width increased from 220px to 280px to better display quotation labels with customer names and date ranges

### ✅ Payment Vouchers — Beneficiary Bank Details Consistency

**Problem:** The "BENEFICIARY BANK DETAILS" table was appearing on "Online" payment vouchers but was completely missing from "Bank Transfer" vouchers.

**Root Cause:** The template generator in `document-template-utils.ts` had restrictive logic that hid the bank details table for direct payments or float transfers if explicit bank details were missing, leading to inconsistent voucher layouts for identical payment methods.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/document-template-utils.ts` — Updated the `beneficiary_bank_details` placeholder logic to **always** render the bank details table for any payment method that is NOT `Cheque`, `Cash`, or `Petty Cash` (e.g., Bank Transfer, Online). This ensures visual consistency across all digital payment methods and provides a fillable area even if bank details aren't digitally captured.

### ✅ Critical GL Double-Posting Fix — Yutong Invoice Idempotency Guard

**Problem:** `useYutongInvoiceManagement.ts` called both `createVehicleARInvoice()` (which auto-posts GL when status ≠ 'draft') and `postVehicleInvoiceToGL()` unconditionally, creating **two identical revenue recognition journal entries** per invoice approval/sync. This inflated the Sales Revenue (41101001) ledger by 2x for affected Yutong invoices.

**Root Cause:** The quotation-based Yutong invoice hook (`useYutongInvoiceManagement.ts`) lacked the `skipRevenueGL` guard that was already present in the order-based hook (`useYutongOrderInvoiceManagement.ts`) and the Sinotruk hook.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useYutongInvoiceManagement.ts` — Added `journal_entry_id` check guard to both `approveInvoice` and `syncInvoiceToFinanceHub` methods. After `createVehicleARInvoice` returns, the code now queries `ar_invoices.journal_entry_id` — if it already exists (set by the auto-GL-post inside `createVehicleARInvoice`), the subsequent `postVehicleInvoiceToGL` call is skipped entirely. Matches the idempotency pattern in `useYutongOrderInvoiceManagement.ts` and `useSinotrukOrderInvoiceManagement.ts`.

**Architecture Notes:**
- All vehicle sales GL posting now follows the same idempotency contract: `createVehicleARInvoice` is the **single source of truth** for revenue recognition GL. `postVehicleInvoiceToGL` is only called as a fallback when the AR invoice was created without auto-posting (e.g., draft status).
- **Database cleanup may be required** for historically double-posted invoices: look for duplicate JEs sharing the same `reference` field containing the same invoice number.

### ✅ Bank Reconciliation — Transaction Visibility & Lineage Stabilization

**Problem:** Manual Journal Entries (JEs) and Quick-Add bank transactions were missing from the Bank Reconciliation "System Records (Book)" panel. Root cause was a strict `company_id` filter in the reconciliation hook that excluded legacy records with NULL `company_id`, plus the Quick Add workflow failing to inject `company_id` into new records.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useAccountingData.ts` — Refactored `useBankTransactionsForRecon` to use an OR filter (`company_id.eq.X,company_id.is.null`) instead of strict equality. Ensures legacy records without `company_id` appear in the reconciliation view. Made `bank_account_id` a required filter (was optional).
- `src/components/accounting/BankReconciliationWorksheet.tsx` — Fixed `handleQuickAdd` to include `company_id: effectiveCompanyId` in the bank_transaction insert payload.
- `src/hooks/useAccountingMutations.ts` — Fixed Rules of Hooks violation in `useCreateBankTransaction`: removed inner `useCompany()` call from `mutationFn` (not a React component). Moved `getBusinessUnitCode` destructuring to outer scope. Added `bank-transactions-recon` query invalidation on success.

**Migration Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260513170000_backfill_bank_transactions_company_id.sql` — Backfill: inherits `company_id` from parent `bank_accounts`, sets `source_type='manual'` for NULL entries, links `journal_entry_id` for JE-sourced transactions.

**Backfill Script:**
- `backfill_bank_company_id.ts` — Standalone script (`npx tsx backfill_bank_company_id.ts`) for runtime backfill via Supabase JS client.

**Architecture Notes:**
- Bank Reconciliation now uses `bank_account_id` as primary scope (bank accounts are already company-owned), with `company_id` as a secondary inclusive filter
- Pattern: `OR(company_id = X, company_id IS NULL)` ensures backward compatibility for legacy data

### ✅ Finance Modal Auto-Close & Double-Post Prevention

**Problem:** "Confirm & Post to GL" modal dialogs in the Special Hire finance workflow lacked loading states and auto-close behavior, allowing users to click multiple times and potentially create duplicate journal entries.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/special-hire/FinanceApprovalPreviewModal.tsx` — Added `isPosting` loading state with disabled button + spinner during GL posting. Cancel button also disabled during posting. Prevents double-click duplicate GL entries.
- `src/components/special-hire/FinanceApprovalModal.tsx` — Added `useEffect` hooks to reset internal `action` state when modal closes or loading completes. Prevents stale "Approving..." button labels on modal re-open. Also resets `notes` and `rejectionReason` on close for clean slate.

**Architecture Notes:**
- These are purely local React state management changes — no database, hook, or pipeline logic was modified.
- Pattern follows established auto-close standard from `YutongPaymentTracking.tsx` and `VehicleFinanceSettlement.tsx`.
- `FinanceApprovalPreviewModal.onConfirm` is now awaited as async, enabling the loading state to persist until the parent's GL posting resolves.

### ✅ Fuel Analytics — Standard Rate Correction, Odometer Quick-Adjust & PDF Export

**Problem:** All buses defaulted to an incorrect `8 km/L` standard rate, causing false performance signals. Odometer data entry errors (e.g. `135,814 km` in a single day) had no correction mechanism. No PDF export existed for fuel reports.

**Migration Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260512043000_update_bus_standard_rates.sql` — **[NEW]** Multi-stage migration:
  - **Stage 1:** Bus-specific rates for 27 identified buses from the operational spreadsheet
  - **Stage 2:** Model-based catch-all (C9→6, D7→7, C12 Pro→3.8, Leyland→3.5 km/L)
  - Uses idempotent pattern: only updates buses with `expected_km_per_liter >= 8` or `NULL`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/trips-analytics/FuelAnalyticsSection.tsx`:
  - **Odometer Quick-Adjust UI:** Added inline correction dialog with per-trip start/end meter inputs, live mileage preview, anomaly detection (>2,000 km/day flagged red), and atomic `daily_trips` update with distance recalculation
  - **PDF Report Export:** Added `handleExportPDF()` using jsPDF + autoTable. Generates landscape A4 PDF with company header, date, color-coded columns (yellow=consumption, blue=standard rate, green/red=performance), anomaly flags (⚠), and page footers. Button: "PDF Report" next to date picker

**Architecture Notes:**
- Standard rates source: `buses.expected_km_per_liter` — shared by both Fleet Master Spreadsheet and Trips Analytics
- Quick-adjust atomically updates `odometer_start`, `odometer_end`, and `distance_km` per trip, then triggers `onDataCorrected()` callback to refetch analytics
- PDF uses same calculation logic as the on-screen table to ensure visual parity

### ✅ Yutong Invoice Backdating & Finance Sync

**Files Modified:**
- `FleetONE-fresh/src/components/yutong/YutongInvoiceTypeModal.tsx` — Added an "Invoice Date" date picker to the generator modal, allowing users to select a backdated date for invoices.
- `FleetONE-fresh/src/components/yutong/YutongOrderInvoiceGenerator.tsx` — Updated to consume the selected `invoiceDate`. Added a UI badge ("Backdated to [Date]") to visually flag backdated invoices in the list.
- `src/hooks/useVehicleSalesFinance.ts` — Updated `createVehicleARInvoice` and `postVehicleInvoiceToGL` functions to accept and use the selected `invoiceDate`. This ensures AR invoices, due dates (calculated +30 days), and GL journal entries match the backdated date instead of `new Date()`.
- `src/hooks/useYutongOrderInvoiceManagement.ts` — Plumbed `invoiceDate` through the `generateAndStoreDraftInvoice` and `approveInvoice` flows.

**Architecture Notes:**
- The actual physical PDF documents generated do not display a "backdated" mark, they naturally reflect the selected date as the official document date.

## 2026-05-06

### ✅ Industrialized School Bus Financial Documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/document-template-seeder.ts` — Registered `school_invoice` and `school_receipt` templates. Implemented `generateSchoolInvoiceTemplate` and `generateSchoolReceiptTemplate` using the dynamic `{{SECTION}}` marker system. Fixed a `ReferenceError` by moving template function definitions before their usage in the `defaultTemplates` object.
- `src/components/accounting/settings/DocumentTemplateEditor.tsx` — Fixed a JSX syntax error where `{{SECTION:...}}` text was being incorrectly parsed as a JavaScript expression. Wrapped the text in a string literal.
- `src/lib/document-template-utils.ts` — Extended `mapDocumentToPlaceholders` to handle school-specific data points (`student_name`, `admission_no`, `grade`, `invoice_month`, etc.). Fixed a syntax error (missing closing brace) that was breaking the module structure.
- `src/components/school/SchoolBusFinanceSettlement.tsx` — Integrated `FinanceDocumentPreviewModal` and added "Print Invoice" and "Print" buttons to the Invoices and Payments tabs.
- `src/components/school/PaymentHistoryModal.tsx` — Integrated `FinanceDocumentPreviewModal` and added a print icon button to each transaction row.

**Architecture Notes:**
- Standardized on the ERP's dynamic section system, allowing users to customize Bank Details, T&Cs, and Signatures via the `DocumentTemplateEditor`.
- Mapped operational school bus data directly to financial placeholders for zero-config document generation.

## 2026-05-03

### ✅ SPH AR Templates Line Items & Signature Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/document-template-seeder.ts` — Updated the `generateSPHARInvoiceTemplate` and `generateSPHARReceiptTemplate` functions. Replaced the generic `{{line_items}}` table (which rendered "No line items" because `ar_invoice_lines` aren't created for SPH) with a hardcoded SPH-specific layout matching the operations side (Description: Special Hire, Item Detail: `{{notes}}`, Amount: `{{total_amount}}`). Also updated `{{subtotal}}` to fallback to `{{total_amount}}` so it no longer shows `0.00`. Fixed logo sizing issue by switching `{{company_logo_url}}` to `{{company_logo}}` with `!important` CSS overrides.
- `src/lib/document-template-utils.ts` — Added missing signature placeholders (`{{prepared_by}}`, `{{verified_by}}`, `{{approved_by}}` and their corresponding image signature tags) inside the `ar_invoice` and `ar_receipt` mapping logic. Previously, these were completely missing from these document types.

### 🔧 Lyceum Hire Overtime — Unified km/10 Available Hours

**Business Logic Change:** Lyceum hire overtime calculation now uses the same **km ÷ 10** distance-based available hours as Outside hire. Previously Lyceum used fixed rate card `standard_hours` blocks (4h/8h).

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/special-hire/CostCalculator.tsx` — Replaced simple `standardHours` subtraction with `calculateExtraTimeCharge()` using `useStandardHours: false`. Added `availableHours` to `rateCardDetails`.
- `src/components/special-hire/SpecialHireForm.tsx` — Updated 5 locations (multi-bus, single-bus, initial data load, rateCardDetails, live preview) to use `km/10` for Lyceum instead of `standard_hours`.
- `src/components/special-hire/EnhancedCostCalculator.tsx` — Updated recalculation fallback and `rateCardDetails.availableHours` to use `km/10` for all hire types.

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Setup — GitHub Actions

**Files Created:**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — **[NEW]** Continuous Integration workflow: runs Lint, Type Check, Build, and Unit Tests as 4 parallel jobs on every push/PR. Uses Node 20, npm caching, and uploads build artifacts. Includes `workflow_call` trigger for reuse by deploy workflow.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — **[NEW]** Continuous Deployment workflow: triggers on push to `main` only. Calls CI workflow first, then deploys to VPS via SSH (`appleboy/ssh-action@v1`). Runs `git pull → npm install → npm run build → nginx reload`. Requires GitHub Secrets: `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USER`, `VPS_SSH_KEY`, `VPS_APP_DIR`.

**Architecture Notes:**

- CI is reusable via `workflow_call` — deploy.yml calls it with `uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Deploy only runs after all 4 CI jobs pass (`needs: ci`)
- Uses `environment: production` for deployment protection rules (optional)

### 🔍 Special Hire System Audit — 3 GL Gap Fixes

**Audit Scope:** 67 components, 17 hooks across the entire Special Hire financial system.

**Critical GL Gaps Fixed:**

- **Post-Trip Adjustment GL:** `PostTripAdjustmentModal.handleFinalize` now posts DR Trade Receivable / CR Revenue via new `postPostTripAdjustmentToGLStandalone` (extra KM, time, expenses were previously invisible to GL)
- **Enhanced Status Modal Refund GL:** `EnhancedTripStatusManagementModal.handleSubmit` now posts DR Customer Advance / CR Bank via `postRefundToGLStandalone` (the basic modal had this, the enhanced version didn't)
- **Discount GL Posting:** `GenerateBalanceInvoiceModal.handleEmailToCustomer` now posts DR Discount Expense / CR Trade Receivable via new `postDiscountToGLStandalone` (discount hook existed but was never called from UI)

**Accounting Fix:** Invoice GL now posts **gross** amount before discount, with a separate discount entry (previously netted before posting).

**New Standalone Functions (useSpecialHireFinance.ts):**

- `postPostTripAdjustmentToGLStandalone` — DR Trade Receivable / CR Revenue
- `postDiscountToGLStandalone` — DR Discount Expense / CR Trade Receivable

---

### 🚀 Advanced Finance Automation — 4 GL Fixes + Automation Engine

**Critical GL Integration Fixes (useAccountingMutations.ts):**

- **AR Invoices:** `useCreateARInvoice` now auto-posts DR Trade Receivable / CR Sales Revenue via `postARInvoiceToGL`
- **AP Invoice Approval:** `useApproveAPInvoice` now auto-posts DR Expense / CR Trade Payable via `postAPInvoiceToGL`
- **Recurring Entries:** `useRunRecurringEntry` now creates real journal entries via `createAndPostJournalEntry` (was only updating `last_run_date`)
- **Fund Transfers:** `useCreateFundTransfer` now posts DR/CR to respective bank accounts

**New Files Created:**

- `src/hooks/useFinanceAutomationEngine.ts` — 6 hooks: overdue entry detection, batch execution, GL balance health check, discrepancy fix, recent auto-posts, module health monitoring
- `src/components/accounting/FinanceAutomationDashboard.tsx` — Command-center: module health status, overdue entry runner, GL balance checker, recent post log

**Modified:**

- `src/pages/Accounting.tsx` — Added "Automation Engine" tab as default in Automation module

---

### ✅ Finance Integration Hooks — 6 New GL Posting Modules

**Files Created:**

- `src/hooks/usePayrollFinance.ts` — **[NEW]** GL posting for payroll batches (DR Salary/Overtime/Bonus Expense, CR PAYE/EPF/ETF Payable, CR Bank). Supports salary, overtime, bonuses, statutory deductions.
- `src/hooks/useCommissionFinance.ts` — **[NEW]** GL posting for commission payouts (DR Commission Expense / CR Bank). Handles bank balance updates and bank transaction records.
- `src/hooks/useMaintenanceFinance.ts` — **[NEW]** GL posting for vehicle maintenance costs (DR Maintenance Expense / CR Bank or AP). Supports parts/labor cost splitting and AP invoice creation for credit purchases.
- `src/hooks/useInsuranceFinance.ts` — **[NEW]** GL posting for insurance: premium payments (DR Prepaid Insurance / CR Bank), monthly amortization (DR Insurance Expense / CR Prepaid Insurance), and claim recoveries (DR Claims Receivable / CR Claims Income).
- `src/hooks/useExpenseRequestFinance.ts` — **[NEW]** GL posting for approved expense requests (DR Expense / CR Bank/Cash/AP). Maps expense categories to GL accounts. Supports petty cash, bank, IOU, and AP payment methods.
- `src/hooks/useRoutePermitFinance.ts` — **[NEW]** GL posting for route permits (DR Permit Expense or Prepaid / CR Bank). Distinguishes annual (capitalize + amortize) vs temporary (expense immediately) permits.
- `supabase/migrations/20260218_create_module_finance_settings.sql` — **[NEW]** Creates `module_finance_settings` table for per-module GL account mappings. Adds `gl_posted` and `journal_entry_id` columns to `asset_maintenance_logs` and `expense_requests`.

### ✅ Finance Hooks — UI Wiring (GL Posting Triggers)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/StaffAttendancePayroll.tsx` — Added "Post to GL" button on payroll batches. Added "Pay & Post to GL" button for approved commissions.
- `src/components/accounting/assets/AssetMaintenanceView.tsx` — Auto-posts maintenance cost to GL on completion. Added GL status column and manual "Post GL" button for completed entries.
- `src/components/accounting/ExpenseReviewView.tsx` — Auto-posts to GL on expense approval. Added GL status column and manual "Post GL" button. Uses `ExpenseRequestForGL` interface with `settings` + `mappings` params.
- `src/pages/RoutePermits.tsx` — Auto-posts permit cost to GL when `annual_fee > 0`. Distinguishes annual (>90 days, 12-month coverage) vs temporary permits.
- `src/components/accident/AccidentDetailsModal.tsx` — Auto-posts insurance claim recovery to GL when status changes to Approved/Settlement with approved_amount > 0.

**Architecture Notes:**

- All 6 hooks follow the same pattern: fetch/save per-module settings from `module_finance_settings`, create journal entries with double-entry lines, update COA balances, update bank balances, create bank transactions
- GL account mappings are configuration-driven via `module_finance_settings` (JSONB `settings` column, keyed by `company_id` + `module_name`)
- No existing hook files were modified — zero regression risk

### ✅ Module GL Mappings — Admin Settings UI

**Files Created / Modified:**

- `src/components/settings/ModuleFinanceSettingsView.tsx` — **[NEW]** Unified admin UI with accordion panels for all 6 finance modules (Payroll, Commissions, Maintenance, Insurance, Expense Requests, Route Permits). Each panel has searchable GL account selectors, auto-post toggles, JE prefix config, and per-module save. Expense Requests also supports dynamic category-to-GL mappings.
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` — Added "Module GL Mappings" tab to the Settings page.

### ✅ Finance Automation Audit — Auto-Post Toggle Gate Fixes

All 6 new finance modules now properly respect their auto-post toggle settings:

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/accounting/assets/AssetMaintenanceView.tsx` — GL post now gated behind `auto_post_on_complete` toggle
- `src/components/accounting/ExpenseReviewView.tsx` — GL post now gated behind `auto_post_on_approve` toggle
- `src/pages/RoutePermits.tsx` — GL post now gated behind `auto_post_on_renewal` toggle
- `src/components/accident/AccidentDetailsModal.tsx` — GL post now gated behind `auto_post_premium` toggle
- `src/pages/StaffAttendancePayroll.tsx` — Added auto-post after payroll generation (`auto_post_on_process`) and after commission bulk approval (`auto_post_on_paid`)

## 2026-02-17

### ✅ Budget Section — Company-Wise Filtering & GL-Linked Actuals

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/budgeting/BudgetDashboard.tsx` — Added `useCompany()` context for company-wise filtering. All queries (budgets, line items, GL entries, expense accounts) now filter by `effectiveCompanyId` with proper cache key invalidation.
- `src/components/budgeting/BudgetAnalytics.tsx` — Added `useCompany()` context for company-wise filtering on all queries. Added `glAccountSpending` map that computes actual spending from GL journal entry lines per COA account. Category analysis and top variances now use GL-derived actuals when `account_id` is linked to a budget line item, falling back to manual `actual_amount` otherwise.

**Architecture Notes:**

- Both components follow the same pattern as `FinancialStatementsView`: `useCompany()` → `getEffectiveCompanyId()` → `.eq("company_id", ...)` on queries
- GL-linked actuals: `budget_line_items.account_id` → matches `journal_entry_lines.account_id` → sums `debit - credit` for expense accounts within fiscal year
- Queries re-fetch automatically when company changes via `queryKey` including `effectiveCompanyId`

### ✅ P&L and Balance Sheet — Journal-Entry-Based Rebuild

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/accounting/FinancialStatementsView.tsx` — **Major rewrite:** Rebuilt Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet reports to calculate figures from `journal_entry_lines` instead of aggregating raw transaction tables. Added date-range filtering for P&L and point-in-time reporting for Balance Sheet. Implemented PDF export for both financial statements using browser print API. Added export toolbar with PDF download button.

### ✅ Budget Dashboard YTD Fix & Budget Analytics Tab

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/budgeting/BudgetDashboard.tsx` — Fixed YTD actual spending calculation to correctly sum from journal entries within the budget period. Rebuilt variance analysis to compare budgeted vs. actual (journal-entry-derived) amounts. Added Budget Analytics tab with visual charts for budget vs. actual comparison, category breakdowns, and trend analysis.
- `src/pages/Budgeting.tsx` — Updated tab navigation to include new Budget Analytics tab.

### 🔧 Minor Fixes (Auto-Numbering & Cash Flow)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/accounting/ARInvoiceForm.tsx` — Minor fix for auto-numbering integration
- `src/components/accounting/JournalEntryForm.tsx` — Minor fix for auto-numbering integration
- `src/components/accounting/CustomerMasterView.tsx` — Minor UI adjustments
- `src/components/accounting/VendorMasterView.tsx` — Minor UI adjustments
- `src/hooks/useCashFlowData.ts` — Minor cash flow reconciliation fix

## 2026-02-16

### ✅ Bank Reconciliation — SAP B1-Style Rewrite

**Files Modified / Created:**

- `src/hooks/useAccountingData.ts` — Added `useLastReconciliation` hook (fetches last completed reconciliation for "Last Statement Balance" carry-forward)
- `src/hooks/useAccountingMutations.ts` — Added `useSaveBankReconciliation` mutation (creates reconciliation record + items, marks transactions as reconciled in `bank_transactions`)
- `src/components/accounting/BankReconciliationWorksheet.tsx` — **Full rewrite:** SAP B1-style unified transaction table with ☑ Cleared checkboxes, Type badges (DP/PS/FT/FC/IN), editable Cleared Amount, Payment/Deposit columns, Select All, Display filter (All/Not Cleared/Cleared), Statement No., Statement Date, Statement Ending Balance, Last Statement Balance, bottom summary bar (Payment/Deposit totals + Cleared Book Balance + Statement Ending Balance + Difference ✓/⚠), Save/Cancel/Adjustments buttons, Adjustments dialog
- `src/components/accounting/BankReconciliationWorksheet.css` — **[NEW]** External CSS for all worksheet styles (no inline styles)

**Architecture Notes:**

- Single unified table replaces old side-by-side view — matches SAP B1 reconciliation UX
- Reconciliation save flow: creates `bank_reconciliations` header → `bank_reconciliation_items` per cleared transaction → updates `bank_transactions.is_reconciled`
- Last Statement Balance auto-loads from most recent completed reconciliation

### ✅ School Bus Payment Balance → COA Liability Integration

**Files Modified:**

- `src/hooks/useSchoolBusFinance.ts` — Added `advance_payments_liability_account_id` to interface and sanitizer. Modified `usePostPaymentToGL` to split credits for overpayments (DR Bank / CR Trade Receivables + CR Advance Payments Liability). Updated `useGenerateBulkARInvoices` to auto-apply student advance balances with reverse liability GL entries (DR Advance Liability / CR Trade Receivables).
- `src/components/school/RecordPaymentModal.tsx` — Passes `fixedAmount` and `overpaymentAmount` to GL posting. Shows COA liability note when student overpays.
- `src/components/school/SchoolBusFinanceSettings.tsx` — Added "Advance Payments Liability Account" selector (filtered to liability-type COA accounts). Added Journal Entry Preview card for advance balance postings (overpayment + monthly auto-apply).

**DB Migration Required:** `ALTER TABLE school_bus_finance_settings ADD COLUMN advance_payments_liability_account_id UUID REFERENCES chart_of_accounts(id);`

### 🔧 Overpayment GL Posting Fix — Setting Not Persisting + Wrong Calculation

**Files Modified:**

- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` — Added `advance_payments_liability_account_id` to Row/Insert/Update types for `school_bus_finance_settings`
- `src/hooks/useSchoolBusFinance.ts` — Added `patchLiabilityAccount` direct REST API fallback (bypasses PostgREST schema cache). Added error-based save fallback in `useUpdateSchoolBusFinanceSettings`. Removed `Record<string, unknown>` cast in `usePostPaymentToGL`.
- `src/components/school/SchoolBusFinanceSettings.tsx` — Removed `Record<string, unknown>` cast for loading settings
- `src/components/school/RecordPaymentModal.tsx` — Fixed overpayment calculation: `receivedAmount > amountDue` instead of `newBalance > 0`

**Issues Fixed:**

1. PostgREST schema cache not recognizing newly-added column → direct REST API PATCH fallback
2. Overpayment amount calculation used cumulative balance check instead of direct comparison

**Architecture Notes:**

- Double-entry bookkeeping: overpayments credited to liability, auto-debited when next month's invoices are generated
- IAS/IFRS compliant customer prepayment handling
- Follows existing consolidated GL pattern (NCG Holding hierarchy)

### ✅ COA Inline Add Child Row Feature

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/accounting/ChartOfAccountsTree.tsx` — Added `[+]` button on every tree row (folder nodes and leaf accounts). Clicking opens an inline form row with auto-suggested account code (based on sibling numbering patterns), inherited account type, and editable fields. Saves via `useCompanyCreateAccount` with proper level1-5 derivation. Added `parent_account_id` to Account interface.
- `src/components/accounting/ChartOfAccountsView.tsx` — Passes `allAccounts` and `onAccountCreated={refetch}` props to `ChartOfAccountsTree`.

### ✨ Per-Bus-Type Breakdowns in CostBreakdown (Multi-Bus Fleet)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/special-hire/SpecialHireForm.tsx` — `busFleetDetails` entries now include per-bus-type fields: `fixed_rate_per_bus`, `overtime_charge_per_bus`, `overnight_charge_per_bus`, `exceeding_charge_per_bus`, `bus_type_efficiency`, `fuel_liters_per_bus`.
- `src/components/special-hire/CostBreakdown.tsx` — When a quotation has **different** bus types, the Hire Charges Breakdown, Extra Time Charges, and Deductions (Fuel & Maintenance) sections now render **separate per-bus-type cards** instead of merged/averaged values. Same-type fleets still display merged. Working Hours Analysis remains shared.

**Trigger:** `hasMultipleBusTypes = new Set(buses.map(b => b.bus_type_name)).size > 1`

### 🐛 Fix Multi-Bus Category Totals — Fuel Double-Counting & Display

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/special-hire/SpecialHireForm.tsx` — `calculateMultiBusFleetCosts`: `grossRevenue` now stores hire charges only (was `combinedSubtotal` which included fuel+maintenance). Fuel added explicitly to `preCommissionTotal`. `setCostData` now includes all missing display fields (hireCharge, fixedRate, overtime, overnight, pickupDateTime, dropDateTime, busTypeEfficiency, fuelPricePerLiter, maintenanceRatePerKm, etc.).
- `src/components/special-hire/QuotationPreview.tsx` — Per-bus "Total Cost" column now shows `hire_charge_per_bus × quantity` (was `subtotal_all_buses` which bundled internal fuel+maintenance costs).
- `src/components/special-hire/CostBreakdown.tsx` — Multi-bus fuel/maintenance calculations now use stored per-bus-type values instead of recalculating with single busTypeEfficiency. Fixes 1-rupee rounding errors and incorrect totals for mixed bus types.
  **Root Cause:** Multi-bus `grossRevenue` included fuel+maintenance, but `QuotationPreview.calculateFinalCustomerTotal()` added `fuel_cost_fuel_only` again → fuel double-counted. CostBreakdown recalculated fuel using one bus type's efficiency for all types → wrong amounts.

### 🔍 Finance & Operations Full Audit (commit: `9f7bee7`)

**Audit Result:** All 13 finance modules (92 sub-tabs) have components present and working. No missing features found in the local codebase.
**Critical Finding:** The staging deployment has a Lovable-generated page at `/accounting/advances/receipts` referencing a non-existent `advance_receipts` table. **This table does NOT exist in Supabase.** The correct implementation uses `ar_receipts` with `is_advance: true` flag. Re-deploying from `main` fixes this.

### ✅ GL Journal Entry Line Details (commit: `9e28926`)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/hooks/useAccountingData.ts` — Fixed `useJournalEntryLines` hook: changed `.order('line_number')` to `.order('debit', { ascending: false })` since `line_number` column doesn't exist. Used explicit FK alias `chart_of_accounts:account_id`.
- `src/components/accounting/JournalEntryDetailDialog.tsx` — Enhanced Entry Lines display: account code on first line, account name below, debit in green, credit in blue. Added empty state fallback.

### ✅ NCG Express GL Auto-Posting (commits: `09f5494`)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/hooks/useNCGExpressFinance.ts` — Added two new exported functions:
  - `autoPostTripIfEnabled(tripId)` — Checks `ncg_express_finance_settings.auto_post_revenue`, fetches trip, calls `postTripRevenueToGL` if enabled.
  - `autoPostExpenseIfEnabled(busId, date)` — Checks `ncg_express_finance_settings.auto_post_expenses`, fetches expense, calls `postExpensesToGL` if enabled.
- `src/components/trips/InlineRevenueEditor.tsx` — Calls `autoPostTripIfEnabled` after saving trip revenue.
- `src/components/trips/InlineExpenseEditor.tsx` — Calls `autoPostExpenseIfEnabled` after saving expenses.
- `src/components/trips/AddTripForm.tsx` — Changed insert to return trip ID via `.select('id').single()`. Calls `autoPostTripIfEnabled` after creating new trip.
- `src/components/trips/QuickEntryPanel.tsx` — Calls `autoPostTripIfEnabled` after updating trip income/expenses.

### ✅ NCG Express Dropdown Fix (commit: `956c3d9`)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/hooks/useNCGExpressFinance.ts` — Removed `account_type` filter from COA dropdown queries in the NCG Express account mapping settings. All chart of accounts now appear in dropdowns regardless of type.

### ✅ COA Transaction Drill-Down for All Levels (commit: `7c81ec5`)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/accounting/ChartOfAccountsTree.tsx` — Enabled "View Transactions" action button for all COA hierarchy levels (1-5), not just level 5 leaf accounts.

### ✅ SpecialHireForm ESLint Fixes (commit: `de202b5`)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/special-hire/SpecialHireForm.tsx` — Fixed 31 ESLint errors (unused vars, missing types, any types).

## Key Architecture Notes for Lovable

### NCG Express Finance Settings

- Table: `ncg_express_finance_settings`
- Key flags: `auto_post_revenue`, `auto_post_expenses`
- When enabled, trips/expenses auto-post to GL on save (non-blocking)
- Settings hook: `useNCGExpressFinance.ts`

### GL Posting Flow

- Revenue: `DR Cash/Bank | CR Ticket Revenue` → via `postTripRevenueToGL()`
- Expenses: `DR Expense Account | CR Cash/Bank` → via `postExpensesToGL()`
- Auto-posting functions are standalone async utilities, NOT React hooks

### Journal Entry Lines

- Table: `journal_entry_lines` — does NOT have `line_number` column
- FK: `account_id` → `chart_of_accounts`
- Query must use `chart_of_accounts:account_id (...)` for reliable joins

### Important Constants

- `NCG_EXPRESS_COMPANY_ID`: `'7ece7595-8b7b-46de-8bfc-c1e8e0da7513'`
- `BUSINESS_UNIT_CODE`: `'NCGE'`

### ⚠️ AR Receipts & Advances (CRITICAL)

- **DO NOT** create or reference an `advance_receipts` table — it does NOT exist
- Advances are stored in `ar_receipts` table with `is_advance: true`
- Mutation: `useCreateARReceipt` in `useAccountingMutations.ts`
- UI: `ARReceiptForm.tsx` with `isAdvanceMode` prop
- Allocations: `ar_receipt_allocations` table links receipts to invoices

### Module Finance Settings (GL Account Mappings)

- Table: `module_finance_settings` — stores per-module GL account configurations
- Key columns: `company_id`, `module_name` (unique together), `settings` (JSONB)
- Module names: `payroll`, `commissions`, `maintenance`, `insurance`, `expense_requests`, `route_permits`
- Each hook reads/writes settings from this table using the same pattern
- Related columns added: `asset_maintenance_logs.gl_posted`, `asset_maintenance_logs.journal_entry_id`, `expense_requests.gl_posted`, `expense_requests.journal_entry_id`
